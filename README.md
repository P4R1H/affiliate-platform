# Affiliate Reconciliation Platform

End-to-end system for receiving affiliate-reported performance metrics, normalizing and verifying them against platform-sourced data, and surfacing discrepancies & trust signalsâ€”optimized for extensibility and rapid iteration.

## System Overview

Core responsibilities:
1. Accept affiliate submissions (API now; Discord-style ingestion planned but schema-ready).
2. Normalize links & enrich platform context (e.g., Reddit permalink normalization).
3. Generate or fetch platform truth metrics (mock adapters for now; real integration boundary preserved).
4. Reconcile claims vs truth & log discrepancies for auditability.
5. Maintain affiliate trust score as lightweight fraud/quality signal.
6. Expose structured, typed API responses for downstream dashboards / analytics.

Status: A lean but production-aligned coreâ€”no speculative abstractions, only primitives required by the brief + targeted integrity & governance improvements.

# Affiliate Reconciliation Platform

Fast, extensible system for ingesting affiliateâ€‘reported performance metrics, reconciling them against platform truth, surfacing discrepancies, and tracking affiliate trust.

</div>

## 1. Highâ€‘Level Overview
This project implements an endâ€‘toâ€‘end reconciliation workflow:
* Accept submissions (API today; Discord ingestion schema-ready)
* Normalize links & identify platform context
* Fetch or simulate platform metrics via modular adapters (mock-first, real-ready)
* Reconcile claimed vs truth metrics, log outcomes, emit alerts, update trust scores
* Provide typed, documented API responses for downstream analytics / dashboards

The implementation is intentionally lean: only primitives needed for correctness, integrity, and extensibilityâ€”no speculative abstractions.

## 2. Key Enhancements vs Original Brief
These deliberate deviations / additions are explicitly documented for reviewer transparency:
| Area | Brief Expectation | Delivered Enhancement |
|------|-------------------|-----------------------|
| Reconciliation cadence | Periodic batch | Immediate + onâ€‘demand via internal queue (faster feedback) |
| Platform integrations | Mock allowed | Unified adapter contract enabling dropâ€‘in real clients |
| Evidence handling | Potential screenshot proofs | Removed image storage (attack surface + redundancy) using JSON evidence fallback |
| Data granularity | Campaign/date implied | Postâ€‘centric model with historical snapshots |
| Inconsistency detection | Basic comparison | Discrepancy scaffolding + alert pipeline + trust scoring |
| Security | Basic auth | API key + role-based admin guard (RBAC scaffold) |
| Observability | Unspecified | Structured logging, metrics hooks, circuit breaker, backoff, priority queue |

See `affiliate-reconciliation-backend/docs/ROADMAP.md` for what is planned next.

## 3. Core Design Choices (Retained Summary)
* **Mockâ€‘first strategy** â€“ Accelerates iteration; real APIs can replace metric generators behind existing interfaces.
* **Postâ€‘centric schema** â€“ Enables precise duplicate prevention and longitudinal reconciliation.
* **Appendâ€‘only reports + immutable logs** â€“ Preserves audit history.
* **Trust scoring** â€“ Lightweight fraud & quality signal (`accurate_submissions / total_submissions`).
* **Immediate reconciliation** â€“ Queue-based trigger instead of cron; lowers detection latency.
* **Enum hardening** â€“ Reduces typo risk (roles, statuses, submission methods).
* **Removed binary proofs** â€“ Less storage, bandwidth, and security overhead.
* **Circuit breaker & backoff utilities** â€“ Resilience primitives for future real API calls.
* **Structured JSON logging** â€“ Correlation IDs + business context for observability.

          â†“
        Persistence (SQLite dev / PostgreSQL target) + Queue + Structured Logging
```

## 5. Tech Stack
* Python 3.11+
* FastAPI + Pydantic (v2 style schemas)
* SQLAlchemy ORM
* Inâ€‘process priority job queue + worker
* Structured logging utilities (JSON)
* Poetry for dependency & environment management

## 6. Quick Start
```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd affiliate-reconciliation-backend
poetry install
poetry run pytest -q      # optional verification
poetry run uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

Optional `.env` (defaults work):
```bash
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./test.db
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
LOG_FILE=logs/app.log
INTEGRATIONS_RANDOM_SEED=12345
MOCK_FAILURE_RATE=0.05
```

## 8. Current Capability Highlights
| Capability | Status |
|------------|--------|
| Multi-platform mock adapters | âœ… |
| Priority job queue + worker | âœ… |
| Reconciliation + discrepancy logging | âœ… |
| Trust scoring updates per reconciliation | âœ… |
| Alert scaffolding (threshold-driven) | âœ… |
| Circuit breaker & backoff utilities | âœ… |
| Structured JSON logging | âœ… |
| RBAC (admin campaign creation) | âœ… |
| Observability extensions (metrics, webhooks) | ðŸš§ Planned |

## 9. Extending
* New platform: add `app/integrations/<platform>.py` implementing fetch + unify â†’ register.
* Real API: swap mock generator with HTTP client, preserve output schema.
* Advanced reconciliation: implement threshold matrix + alert escalation logic.

## 10. Roadmap Snapshot
See full list in `docs/ROADMAP.md`. Near-term priorities: production-grade external queue (Redis/SQS), PostgreSQL migration, Prometheus metrics, webhook/Slack alerting, richer trust weighting.
